# Parking-Management-System
This is my object oriented programming project which enables people to park their vehicles with ease.

In this project we have used object filing in order to store data efficiently. Moreover, this keeps record of the vehicle for how long it is parked even the system is closed.
There are 2 types of vehicles which can be parked : Car and Truck.
Car takes space of 1 and truck takes 2 spaces. We have total of 100 spaces with 10 floors.
We have also implemented colors in order to get pleasing cml interaction.

Happy Coding.
